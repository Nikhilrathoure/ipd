                <h2>Mahabodhi Temple</h2>
                <p> The Mahabodhi temple, also called the "Great Awakening Temple", is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Bodhgaya, Bihar. It is a Buddhist temple that marks the location where the Lord Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment. Lord Buddha holds a very significant place in the religious history of India as he is believed to be the 9th and the most recent incarnation of Lord Vishnu to have walked the earth. The temple spreads over an area of a whopping 4.8 hectares and is 55 meters tall. The Bodhi Tree is situated to the left of the temple and is believed to be the direct descendant of the actual tree under which Lord Gautam Buddha meditated and attained enlightenment and laid down his philosophy for life. The original temple was built by Emperor Ashoka after he turned to Buddhism in order to seek peace and solitude from war and conquests.</p>

                                <h3>Languages Spoken</h3>
                                <div class="e1"><p> Hindi is the official language of Bihar. People bordering Bengal speak Bengali as well. English is widely understood though spoken by a few. Other than these languages, many local dialects are widely spoken. These are Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili. People in the districts of Champaran, Saran, and Shahabad speak Bhojpuri. 

                                    These three Bihari languages/dialects have over 5 million speakers. These languages once mistakenly thought to be dialects of Hindi, but recent research show that these are part of the Eastern Group of Indic languages, along with Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya. 
                                    
                                    While people in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Saharsa, Purnia and Bhagalpur speak Maithili, people in Patna and Gaya speak Magahi. Maithili can be classified as a distinct and uniquely Bihari language because of its rich history of literature. Vidyapati a medieval era Bihar poet composed verses in praise of Lord Krishna with great intensity in Maithili language only. Other dialects spoken in the state of Bihar are Angika, Fiji Hindi, Kudmali, Panchpargania, Sadri, Sarnami, Hindustani, Surajpuri, and Vajjika.

Post-October, a lot of monks, flock from Dharamshala to Bodh Gaya and the city is coloured with maroon robes. Dalai Lama himself spends some time here during December and January.

You can hire a taxi from either of the destinations to travel to Bodh Gaya. There is a direct Druk Air flight from Bangkok Airport.</p>
