		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Rising on the banks of the river Yamuna, the city of Agra has been linked with the history of India, since ancient times. This beautiful city is a perfect example of India’s rich culture and heritage. It is mentioned in the epic tale Mahabharata as ‘Agrevana,' literally translated as ‘border of the forest.' Home to one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal, Agra is a globetrotter’s haven. You can say that the Mughals have left a permanent impression on this city which is evident in the various mausoleums and forts found here.
            </p>                  <!--      change here   -->
        <p>Be mesmerized by the sprawling and majestic Agra Fort. Its many palaces, mosques, and mausoleums are a proud testimonial of Mughal architecture. The legends of the Mughal Emperor Akbar and his fabled courtiers are still kept alive at the ruins of Fatehpur Sikri, which is located on the outskirts of Agra. The chowks (marketplaces) and alleyways found in the city are usually the hub of many activities. Years ago, all the artisans and craftsmen who toiled to make the Taj Mahal a reality set up their houses nearby, creating the network of alleyways known as Taj Ganj. </p>   <!--      change here   -->

                <p>Agra is defined by the majestic Taj Mahal – a promise of eternal love that Tagore described as ‘a teardrop on the cheek of time.’ This is a symbol of true love that Emperor Shah Jahan had for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Crafted in white marble, this mausoleum is one of the seven wonders of the world and for all the right reasons! As you walk through the beautifully developed, lush gardens, you reach this grand structure that reinstates your faith in the power of love. Apparently, a total 20,000 artisans worked relentlessly for about 20 years to build what they might not have thought but came to be known as one of the most spectacular buildings of all time.

                    A walled city in its own right, the Agra Fort stands 2.5 kilometers away from the Taj Mahal and is another one of the Mughal architectural gems in India to have made it to the list of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites. It may interest you to know that this fortification built and rebuilt by various dynasties that ruled the city. However, it was Emperor Shah Jahan who worked on carving the magnificent gardens and grand palaces within the fort. Among the several beautiful buildings inside, some of the most prominent ones include Diwan-e-Aam, which the Mughal emperors used to meet the public audience, Diwan-e-Khas where the emperor would receive royal visitors, Jahangiri Mahal and Rang Mahal, which were utilized by the women of the royal household, Khas Mahal.

                <p>The Sikandara- Akbar's Tomb is a mausoleum of the third Mughal Emporer, Akbar that was commissioned and constructed by Akbar during his lifetime and was later completed by son Jahangir. 8 kilometers away from the main Agra city, the tomb is an important heritage site and is located exactly 1 km from wife Mariam's Tomb. The tomb was constructed using red sandstone with the upper portion completed in marble. Four gateways that lead to the tomb reflect a unique hybrid of different styles of architecture - Hindu, Muslim, Christian and a patent mixture of Akbar's typical style. The main tomb has a different square design.

Located near the Jodha Bai Palace, the Bhawan is intricately crafted and has a double dome structure to keep it cool during summers. Legend has it that this palatial house is secretly connected to the Hathi Pol, which gave direct access to Birbal to the Agra Fort. The city was ultimately abandoned due to the scarcity of water, but this place is still considered one of the best places to visit in Agra.

                        The tomb of Salim Chishti is one of the most significant Sufi shrines in India. Located in Fatehpur Sikri in Agra, the tomb is a fine marble masterpiece and stands where the renowned Sufi mystic- Salim Chishti had his hermitage and had sat in meditation during his lifetime. Akbar constructed this mausoleum as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of Akbar's son. The Tomb's entrance has four thin pillars with unique Gujarati style serpentine steps that arc upwards to the roof. At the entry, the name of God, the Prophet and the four Caliphs of Islam are inscribed. Shah Jahan later added an exquisite pietra dura work as a mark of respect for the saint. For over 400 years, this monument is immaculately preserved by Archaeological Survey of India.

The city was abandoned by the Mughals in 1585 after it had served the ruling capital for almost ten years.

The colossal city has some grand structures, the most prominent one being the imperial compound that is made up of royal palaces, harems, mosque, private quarters and other administration buildings.

                        Often called as a 'jewel box' and the 'Baby Taj,' the tomb of I'timād-ud-Daulah is often regarded as a draft of the Taj Mahal. It is believed to be the first Mughal tomb made of marble with pietra dura artwork. Itmad-Ud-Daulah means ‘Pillar of the Government,' is an exquisite tomb of Mizra Ghiyas Beg, chief minister of Emperor Jahangir and Mumtaz Mahal's grandfather. The tomb was built by Noor Jahan for her father similar to the tomb of Jahangir in Lahore. The monument is delicate in appearance due to its particularly finely carved jali (lattice marble screens). Situated on the banks of Yamuna, the mausoleum is set in a vast cruciform garden crisscrossed by water walkways.
