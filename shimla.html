		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Swathed by cedar, rhododendron, fir and Himalayan oak trees, the state capital of Himachal Pradesh is one of the most popular hill stations of India.Shimla has been a very popular hill-station among Indian families and honeymooners since the last 50 years. </p>

The Ridge and The Mall are still popular landmarks just as they were in the pre-Independence era. The imperial Viceregal Lodge, the graceful Christ Church, Gaiety Theatre, Gorton Castle, Barnes Court and several buildings are part of the colonial architectural heritage of the town.</p>

                <h2>THE RIDGE</h2>
                <p>The large open space that runs east to west alongside The Mall Road is the cultural hub of the city. On a clear day or after a light rain, the views of snow peaks of Himalayan ranges to the north are spectacular. The neo-gothic towering architecture of the Christ Church, the state library in the vicinity, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, the slate roofline of Gaiety Theater and the Town Hall are important landmarks on The Ridge. An underground reservoir build in the 1880s is still one of the major storage for meeting the cities everyday water needs.
