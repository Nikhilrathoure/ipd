                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>"God's Own Country" is how the tourism department of Kerala boasts about the state. Once you visit, you will see where this claim comes from. The state really is blessed with great natural beauty, and diverse ecology.Kerala, a state in Southern India is known as a tropical paradise of waving palms and wide sandy beaches. It is a narrow strip of coastal territory that slopes down the Western Ghats in a cascade of lush green vegetation, and reaches to the Arabian sea. Kerala borders the states of Tamil Nadu to the east and Karnataka to the north. Known for its backwaters, mountains, coconuts, spices and art forms like Kathakali and Mohini Attam as well as land of diverse religions, where you can find Hindu temples, mosques, churches, and even synagogues </p>
                <p> A holiday here is an opportunity for rejuvenation. You can get an Ayurvedic oil massage, spend a day or two on a houseboat with nothing to do but watch coconut trees pass by, or just laze around on Kovalam or Varkala beaches. Thus tourism is more experiential here, rather than being composed of superficial sightseeing options. Kerala was named as one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 places of a lifetime" by the National Geographic Traveler magazine. Kerala is a state wedged between the Western Ghats on the eastern side and the Arabian Sea on the West, thus having a wide range of topography from high altitude mountains to golden beaches and is criss crossed by 41 rivers. The tributaries, unique backwaters, lagoons and numerous small islands provide many scenic attractions for visitors.</p>

                        <p>Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healing tradition that's over 5,000 years old, combines lifestyle practices with yoga and healthy eating. Many Ayurvedic spas and resorts are located in Kerala due to its warm climate and the abundant supply of medicinal plants. A trip to an Ayurvedic healing center can involve a week's stay and detox (called panchakarma), where the liver is purged and the body becomes renewed. Or, you can book any one of their offered treatments, like an oil massage or a Shirodhara, a relaxing treatment that involves dripping warm oil onto the forehead. It is used to treat insomnia, tinnitus, neurological disorders, and psoriasis.</p>
