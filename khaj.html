		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Khajuraho is known around the world for its stunning temples adorned by erotic and sensuous carvings.
            A small town located in the Bundelkhand region in Madhya Pradesh, Khajuraho is a brilliant example of Indian architecture and its culture back in the medieval period. The architecture of these Hindu and Jain temples depict the innocent form of love, the carvings on the walls display passion in the most erotic yet aesthetic ways. Built between 950 to 1050 AD the sheer confrontational nature of these carvings show a stark paradox with the conventional Indian ideals about eroticism, leaving everybody spellbound. Art in this small town is engrained in all of its structures and are a classic example of the finesse of India's cultural and artistic heritage.
