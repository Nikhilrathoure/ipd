		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Once identified as the summer capital of Bihar, Ranchi was also known to be a hill station during the British rule owing to its altitude of 2140 feet, umpteen waterfalls plummeting from pretty hills and the ever so pretty winding rivulets. The city is now the state capital of mineral-rich state Jharkhand and takes immense pride in accounting for the 40 percent of the country’s total mineral reserves. Other than this, the city is bestowed with emerald green forests adding to the natural serenity, tranquillity and nature’s bliss.
            Located at a height of 1, 140 feet above sea level, Ranchi is also the capital of Jharkhand. With the tourism of this city slowly catching pace, Ranchi will soon be considered as one of the important destinations in India. </p>
