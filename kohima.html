		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Kohima is the hilly capital of Nagaland, which is one of the seven sister states of India. ‘Kohima’ is the anglicized name given by the British, the original name being 'Kewhira' derived from the Kewhi flowers found in the region. Famous for its ethereal environment and untouched beauty, it is a land of folklore passed down through the ages. Situated at a height of 1500 metres above the sea level, it is endowed with quaint hills, emerald forests and a picturesque landscape. It is the go-to place for all you adventure enthusiasts as it is ideal for trekking, camping and hiking.
            Kohima was built by the British and is home to the Naga and Kulkis tribe who can amaze one with their independence and a mystical and colourful culture that surrounds them. Kohima finds its place in history as the site of an intense fight with the Japanese, a part of a 64 day long battle during the World War II.
