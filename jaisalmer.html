                <p>One of the largest forts in Rajasthan, Jaisalmer Fort, is a must-see attraction in Jaisalmer. It was built in 1156 A.D by Raja Rawal Jaiswal on the hilltop of Trikuta. Also known as Sonar Quila or the Golden Fort, it captivates you with its tawny lion colour of yellow sandstones during the day which is followed by the honey-gold hues in the evening that also camouflages the fort in the yellow desert. Located in the very heart of the city with around 3000 people residing in its walls, Jaisalmer Fort is a fine example of an urban living centre.
