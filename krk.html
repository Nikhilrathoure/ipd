		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> A city in the state of Haryana, Kurukshetra, also known as Dharmakshetra is known as the "Land of the Bhagavad Gita". Situated 170 km north to Delhi, the place is famous for the battle between the Kauvaras and the Pandavas in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. It is the place where Lord Krishna is said to have recited the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. 
            In the past, Kurukshetra was one of the most important centres for Vedic civilization as well as education. Lord Buddha and several Sikh Gurus are known to have visited and spent time in Kurukshetra. The place has a large number of devout centres, holy shrines and kunds which trace back to the epic ages and the earliest Indian civilisation. Archaeological evidence claim that this city was in existence during the pre-Harrapan times. </p>
