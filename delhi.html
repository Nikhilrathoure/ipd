                <p>The 33-metre long line-up of the red sandstone walls of the Red Fort is a reminder of the great power that Mughals exerted over Delhi. Even now, the buildings inside the fort can make your senses reel under the cumulative impact of marble, gilded pillars, delicate carvings, and the realization that it was inlaid with precious gems at one point in time. Commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1638, this attraction took over 10 years to complete. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it sprawls over approximately 254 acres and has beautiful carvings on its walls. The Diwan-I-Am with its painted canopy and the Khas Mahal with its intricate marble jaali are the highlights of this place.

Delhites descend to this attraction on summer nights for enjoying a scoop of ice-cream. You see a lot of people having picnics at this spot during winter afternoons. Kids like to run freely on the large lawns surrounding the arch. At night, the memorial gets beautifully lit up and is a sight to behold. It has also been witness to many candle light marches and processions.

                <p>Qutub Minar is the star attraction of Qutb complex. It is a 73-metre high tower, the construction of which was started by Qutubuddin Aibak but finished by his son-in-law Iltutmish. It was built to celebrate Muslim dominance over Delhi after the defeat of the last Hindu ruler. It is five storey tower that becomes narrower as it goes up thereby providing an illusion of extra height. The two topmost minars, which stand out for being made of marble instead of red sandstone, were added later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq. The highest tower in India, Qutub Minar shows different architectural styles from Aibak to Tughlaq era.

                        One of the first fine examples of Mughal architecture in India, Humayun's Tomb is a magnificent garden tomb located in the eastern part of Delhi. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, its onion-shaped dome is a forerunner of the classic Mughal dome which became more shapely with time. The garden squares with its water channels, pathways and gardens are beautifully restored. Humayun's mausoleum is situated in the center topped by a Persian-style double-dome marble structure. The complex also incorporates the tomb of Isa Khan, the Nai ka Gumbad and Nili Gumbad. You can see intricately carved arches around the whole perimeter of the building.

                        Lotus Temple, also known as the Bahai House of Worship, is a wonderful place to enjoy silence in the noisy city of Delhi. Styled after a lotus flower, it serves as the mother temple of the Indian subcontinent. Designed by Iranian-Canadian architect Fariburz Sahba, the temple was built to bring faiths together. It has 27 immaculate marble petals of a lotus. The particular flower was chosen as its an important symbol in Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism. Around the petals are nine pools of water that look spectacular in the evening when light shadows fall on its surface. People of any religion are welcome to pray and meditate silently in the central hall of this place.
