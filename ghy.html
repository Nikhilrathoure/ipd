		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> A sprawling city located beside the mighty Brahmaputra, Guwahati is the epitome of an amalgamation of ancient history and modernization. The largest city in all of Assam, Guwahati stands as the gateway to the Seven Sisters of North East India. A city shaped by time itself, Guwahati is home to age-old temples that take you centuries back to the pages of ancient history, but it also boasts of a cutthroat lifestyle and an electric nightlife, keeping up with the modern era of urbanisation and commercialization. The gushing Brahmaputra river carries with it untold tales from thousands of years past, and the peaceful ambience lingering in the city despite its modern lifestyle is one of the main reasons you should visit Guwahati if only to get a slice-of-life experience of the vivacious juxtaposition of the old and the new.
            Guwahati is home to a huge number of old temples, all of which have interesting stories and legends behind them. </p>

                <p>Located on the Nilanchal Hill in the western part of Guwahati in Assam,  Kamakhya Temple is one of the most revered shrines of Goddess Shakti in India. According to the Hindu scriptures, there are four important Shakti Peethas (Temples with highest powers of divinity) in the country and Kamakhya Temple is one of them. Kamakhya Temple celebrates the power of the woman to give birth and is regarded as extremely auspicious among the followers of the Tantrik sect of Hinduism. It was built and reconstructed multiple times between the 8th and 17th Centuries and is a spectacle in itself.
                    The main entrance of the Kamakhya temple is beautifully designed with simple yet elegant carvings that are decorated with colourful flowers. The temple has a massive dome which overlooks the quaint Nilanchal Hills in the background. It is especially decked up during the Ambubachi Festival and fare that is held for 3-4 Days in the month of June.
