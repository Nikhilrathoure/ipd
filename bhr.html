                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> The land where the Buddha once lived, a land of monasteries - Bihar is visited by a considerable number of Buddhist followers as well as tourists of other faiths all through the year. Its association with Buddhism and Jainism makes it a must visit place for peace seekers, people who would like to get a feel of the tribal culture and experience life in the rural parts of India, and those who would like to get a glimpse of our glorious past.
                    Derived from the Sanskrit word 'Vihara', which means monastery, Bihar has a glorious heritage in the context of Indian history. Bihar is located in the eastern parts of India situated in the Gangetic plains, and it shares its borders with Uttar Pradesh in the West, Jharkhand in the South, West Bengal in the east, and Nepal in the North. The spiritual importance of Bihar comes from the fact that it is the place where the Buddha once lived and attained Nirvana. His footsteps can be traced through his teachings and the monuments which stand tall to this day, serving to guide people and show them the right
                    path.

                        <p> There are several traditional styles of painting practiced in Bihar. One is Mithila painting, a style of Indian painting used in the Mithila region of Bihar.Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila region, mainly by women. Painting was usually done on walls during festivals, religious events, and other milestones of the life cycle, like birth, Upanayanam(the sacred thread ceremony), and marriage.[13]
                            Mithila painting was traditionally done on huts' freshly plastered mud walls, but today it is also done on cloth, handmade paper, and canvas. Famous Mithila painters have included Smt Bharti Dayal, Mahasundari Devi, the late Ganga Devi, and Sita Devi.
                            Mithila painting is also called Madhubani art. It mostly depicts human beings and their association with nature. Common scenes illustrate deities like Krishna, Ram, Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati from ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, moon, and religious plants like tulsiare also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally no space is left empty

                        <p>  The lip-smacking taste of Litti Chokha, savoured by one and all, needs no introduction. It is your grand welcome to the food of Bihar, in all its ghee-dripping glory. It consists of wheat and sattu with spices, kneaded into round spicy balls, dipped in ghee. The texture of Litti along with the crunchy crust makes it a foodie’s delight. Chokha is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables (most common being potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes), adding spices and chopped onion, garlic etc and served with Litti as a complimentary delicacy.
                            Sattu or fried gram flour forms a distinctive element of Bihari food and cuisine. The sattu is mixed with spices and filled in wheat dough balls, rolled and cooked with ghee on a hot plate to form sattu paratha which is also called makuni.
