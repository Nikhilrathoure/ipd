		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
                Raipur, which was once a part of Madhya Pradesh, is the capital of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. It is also known as the rice bowl of India because of the varieties of rice grown in the region. The Mahanadi river flows through the city.

            </p>                  <!--      change here   -->
        <p>It is one of the fastest growing cities of the country in terms of industries like coal, aluminium, power, steel and tourism. Doodhadhari Monastery, Vivekananda Sarovar, Vivekananda Ashram,  Mahant Ghasidas Museum, Rajiv Gandhi Van and Urja Bhawan are some of the places to visit. One more important point of interest is the Nagar Ghadi which is a clock that plays the folk songs of Chhattisgarh.

                <p>Ghatarani Waterfalls make for a great picnic spot in Raipur. Perched amidst dense vegetation, the moderate cascade can be reached after a short trek through the forest. The hike up to the waterfall is amazing, and one can feast their eyes on the wide-ranging flora and fauna inhabiting in the forest. This tiered waterfall is surrounded by lush greenery as the water gushes down the stone precipice forming milky white foam, making for an ethereal scenic beauty. The waterfall plunges down to create a small and calm pool which is idyllic for enjoying a refreshing sip during the scorching summer heat.
