		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Chandigarh, a union territory that is the capital of both Punjab as well as Haryana is a subtle and ideal definition of the word 'city'. In a culture that includes instances of both traditional Punjab as well as a modernity, Chandigarh is a pretty town resembling a morning dream which is sure to flatter you with its innocence and pleasantness.

            Any tour of Chandigarh needs to begin with the beautiful Sukhna Lake. A huge water body that is entirely manmade, Sukhna Lake is nestled amidst the foothills of the Shivaliks and is one of the best places you can go to wind down and relax. You can go for a boat or shikara ride at the lake, or just take a relaxing walk on the jogging track, where you will often find yourself joined by locals of the city.
            
            Chandigarh has quite a few places for nature lovers to visit, including the Rock Garden, and the Leisure Valley & Rose Garden. Chandigarh's Rock Garden is very well known for having been designed completely out of discarded industrial and urban waste. </p>
