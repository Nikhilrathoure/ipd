		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Home to the Manikya Kings in the past, Agartala is the perfect mix of natural beauty combined with diverse and rich culture.
            Agartala is not just all flowers and valleys but also has a cultural richness with the diversity of people that stay here along with the historical and religious monuments. The capital of Tripuramanages to create its culture and personality out of the coming together of stories of all those who reside here and give it a hue of their own culture. The most developed city in the state, it is still a far cry from the metros and hence maintains the best of both worlds.
