                <p>An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.

                        Situated in the Western part of the beautiful city of Hyderabad at a distance of approximately 9 km from Hussain Sagar Lake, Golconda Fort is one of the region's best-preserved monuments. The construction of this fort was completed in the 1600s and it is reputed for being the area where once, the mighty Koh-I-Noor diamond was stored. It is said that if you clap your hands at the bottom of the fort, the echoes of it can be heard right to the top! The architecture, the legends, the history, and the mystery of Golconda Fort add to its allure and make it one of the must-visit places in Hyderabad.

                <p>Once the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, the Chowmahalla Palace was built in Hyderabad between the years 1857 and 1869. In essence, Chowmahalla can be literally translated to mean 'Four Palaces'. The magnificent monument consists of two massive courtyards as well as a grand dining hall known as 'Khilawat'. This splendid monument that once served as the official residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad during their reign still retains some of its past splendour. It is still the property of Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah, heir of the Nizams and has been decorated with UNESCO's Asia Pacific Merit award in 2010 as well.
